simple script i made to initialize most of my stuff (this assumes you have a desktop environment / tiling wm installed already)
i may release for more distributions if anyone would care but this isnt really that impressive
current software & configuration:
yay, reflector, flatpak, man-db
fish shell, alacritty, fastfetch
eza, bat, zoxide, tldr, fd
git, docker, zed code edtior, rust, python and curl
nvidia-dkms, pipewire, pavucontrol, obs studio
firefox, vesktop (discrod), qbittorrent, steam
btop, ncdu, duf, ufw and timeshift

the script installs the jetbrains mono nerd font and sets it to alacritty's default
makes fish aliases to better alternatives (ls will be eza, cat will be bat, etc)
enables ufw firewall and sets up docker permissions for your user
configures pipewire for you (i think)

after using this u should reboot ur system
if ur fonts look weird and not the jetbrains font in alacritty, run fc-cache -fv
i mainly made this for myself (obviously) tho im posting it here if anyone is interested, i'm learning the rust programming
lnaguage (probably should learn how 2 spell in my native language before learning a new one)
